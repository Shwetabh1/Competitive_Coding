Protocols

Stateless vs Stateful Protocol
In computing, a stateless protocol is a communications protocol in which no information is retained by either sender or receiver, meaning that they are agnostic of the state of one another. The sender transmits a packet to the receiver and does not expect an acknowledgment of receipt. A UDP connectionless session is a stateless connection. HTTP is the other example.
