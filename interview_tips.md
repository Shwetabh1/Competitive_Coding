1. Do as much as mock interviews as possible. [use InterviewBit, Leetcode, etc.]

2. When giving interview do not move to the next problem unless you have all these pointers with you.
    Requirements: Understand.
    Edge cases: Discuss the cases.
    Brute force approach (Discussion + Complexity)
    Optimised approach (Discussion + Complexity) â€¦X times
    ----Once you have it then only move here:
    Coding
    Dry Run

    2.2 When presented with a question never directly solve, do this.

    1. Read question, repeat to interviewer what you understood.
    2. Discuss edge cases and constraints.
    3. Ask for assumptions e.g, what to return if test case does not contain answer, are all letters of string lowercase, can i assume that there are no float values for the list of numbers, etc.,
    4. Discuss pseudo code, ask if you can proceed with the code
    5. Write the code.
    6. Do a dry run with an example.
    7. discuss time and space complexity----> I went wrong here since I just said O(N) or O(N**2)...they expected me to answer like O(M*N) where M is _______ and N is ________, I panicked a lot coz I wasnt clear with my answering.
    8. Always make sure you are on the same page with interviewer. They check to see if you can change your thought process according to their suggestions and whether you will be an effective team player. Communication is key.

3. For each project listed in your resume always be ready with your 
    Challanges
    Mistakes/Failures
    Enjoyment
    Leadership
    Conflicts
    What you did differerently.

4. Prepare in advanced, pointers for a detailed discussion about the projects you have worked on and technologies and design patterns you have used.
